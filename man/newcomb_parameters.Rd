\title{Compute the Newcomb constant and its sensitivity to e^, according to the Sharav-Budnikova model featured by Berger 1973.}
\usage{
newcomb_parameters(
  CAC = CAC_ref,
  omega = omega_solar,
  c = c_ref,
  ece = ece_ref,
  alpha = alpha_ref
)
}
\arguments{
\item{CAC}{is (C-A)/C where A and C are Earth's moments of inertia aroud the plora and equatioral axis of inertia}

\item{omega}{is the rotational angular velocity of the Earth, measured in a geocentric framework}

\item{c}{is the inclination of the  lunar orbit on the ecliptic}

\item{alpha}{is the ratio of moon over earth's masses, multiplied by the ration of earth over moon's semi-major axis, at power 3. It is generally considered to be constant}

\details{
Implementation of expressions for "ell" and "P0" p. 112 of Berger 1973. These variables
are fundamental in the computation of the luni-solar precession (also called axial precession)
In first approximation, the precession frequency (the term k) appearing in astronomical developments
is equal to "ell"*cos(e_bar), where e_bar is the reference value for obliquity. 
d(ell)/d(e^2) = 3/2 P0, where "e" is the obliquity. All parameters are given default values
coresponding to the present-day state.
