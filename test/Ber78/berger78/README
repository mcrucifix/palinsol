insol.f : program to compute orbital parameters and insolation according
          to the solution of Berger (1978)
          total daily irradiation is given in KJ m-2 (to be divided by 86400
          to get it in Wm-2)
          insol.f has been pulicly released and is available as a zenodo dataset
          Berger, A. (1978). Long-term variations of daily insolation and Quaternary climatic changes (Version 2014) [Data set].
